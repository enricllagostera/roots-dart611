### instructions

The final requirement of this course is to submit a refined artist statement and documentation of the final project. The artist statement should build upon the research presentation delivered earlier in the semester, making stronger connections to the physical outcome of the finished piece. This text should be approximately 1000 words in length addressing your influences, the themes of the work, and how they are manifested in the material aspects of the piece. The basis for this document can be directly drawn from previous writing and presentations—it is a means of documenting your process in this course.

Accompanying the statement should be high quality, high-resolution photographic and/or video documentation of the work. Be sure to include shots from all angles, close-ups and establishing shots, as well as screen captures (if applicable).
