Tonight I pushed what should be the last of our basic animations up. The roots draining has been giving me a hard time, and I'm not 100% satisfied so maybe that will need revision... Enric had had an interesting comment about it yesterday though, saying that it looked more "animal" than plant - I think it's interesting to think about how the roots, the unseen, is maybe the scariest/strangest part of the experience...

Today I'll do some work on putting the plants art into the game. After doing that, we'll be able to prepare the game logic to follow the growth / wilt cycle.

After a lot of struggling with Unity's animation system, I managed to get a continuous transition between growing an wilting that is already integrated with the gameplay variables. From there, it was quite quick to get some other features working: plant reproduction and the wind animation via shaders.

Now I'm focusing on getting the bee animations that Rebecca made and create a basic non-player character (NPC) that uses them. The biggest challenge in this is getting the circular movement working. I'll try out some math-based one, but if it doesn't work I'll work with splines and animation.

Today we spent most of our time getting re-situated after the break and planning our steps for the first rough prototype showing. Most of this also involved fighting with Anima2D, which has proved to be a one step forward two step back type thing. It’s use of bones can make some really nice deformations but it has proven to be incompatible with the animation switching system we’ve made. So rather than rely on it, Enric is going to dig up some older shaders that will “ripple” the edges of the sprites to make them seem like they are moving.

On my end of things, I’m going to be focusing on getting our bee character animated, which I think (like the other animations so far) will involve a lot of trial and error. Given how low fi everything is, I’m curious how conveying emotion will happen with the bee’s expressions. I think looking at other kids media with similar styles could help.

When I’d first imagined the character I’d been taken with the idea of an ant because I thought the limbs could be useful to convey postures/expressions, but a bee turned out to help convey the notion of a “caretaker” better. So, for now at least, I feel I’m going to rely more on exaggerated flying…

As well, I’ve discussed with Jonathan writing a case study for this project, and so logs will continue to be more detailed from now on :).

Personal thoughts:
Given an emphasis on the course being a building block in my thesis program, the two most critical elements of this project for me are that we are able to convey “wellness” (through building a sense of community or connection) and “participatory interactions” clearly. I think we have the second element down quite clearly, or at least we will be able to articulate it more easily because people can touch the thing, but linking the garden back to wellness remains a bit elusive.

Project thoughts:
I tried to sketch out the two project directions we seemed to be generally talking about below. I think it would make sense if we went with the scenario where the game was in a physical community location, that it would presumably be played over a longer period of time and have a heavy DIY or modification capability to it so that it doesn’t get dull like some people suggested it could in class. Here, wellness would be evident in the literal community building side of things.

If we went with something that was a bit more installation-y, I think we could still play with time, but maybe use the short nature of an art exhibit to our advantage. The game could still have no end state, but require two (or more?) people to play it for anything to grow properly. In the sketch for this version I even thought it would be cool if we could somehow make holding hands a killswitch of sorts, where you need to have one hand (garden glove?) connected to the other player to start the game, using your free hand to navigate the space.

Let me know if you need help with the chicken scratch ;)

Personal thoughts:
I was thinking a lot about the wellness question too and how it relates to the project as a whole. I realized I have been imagining this game-object-toy as a pivot, an instigator of rituals somehow. Maybe like a playful shrine for self-care. It is part messy, part mysterious, part organic in its fiction. I don’t feel like it needs to be super serious or grave for it, I’d prefer if it had a softer feel overall.

The magic garden-forest mix is for me a good metaphor for dialectical relationships that I see as key for wellness: seen-unseen, conscious-subconscious, agency-structure, short-long term, individual-collective, order-disorder. I think gardens and forests have this tension in them: “What makes a garden beautiful? What about a forest? What makes a plant a weed?”

The garden-forest in a well idea to me is powerful because it draws on fairytale symbolism, which is a great repertoire for invitations and hooks. The idea of invitations (to enter the game-toy fiction) and hooks (to switch to and question reality) is something that is important regardless if we’ll be focusing on children or adults. I think this tensionline is one that we can use to consider each design decision we take. These garden-forest-well symbols can spark discussion by making issues concrete, and by proposing a road for interpretation, a metaphor for processes of self-knowledge.

This is related to how I imagine the players relationship with the caretaker. It would be a limited narrator, one that creates a flimsy conducting thread for the experience. Thinking about the symbolism of the game and its theme, I think it can act as a contradictory narrator: it’s simultaneously a projected self for players but also of an “other” when played collectively. In this way, the narrative perspective it can bring would be enriched by this distancing. Also, I believe this relationship between individual and collective is a very strong relationship to tap into, as it connects directly to how we relate with the tensions in social groups of which we are part, like family, school, and so on.

Another aspect that I think is central is to communicate how time and durations (in general) are fundamental to wellness. Different issues take different times to diff folks in diff contexts with diff levels of engagement, and so on. This can be a great source to think about coping, solidarity, individual and collective. It can also spark conversations about intergenerational wellness and care as this complex, messy, scary, exciting and expressive process. If the process of playing and making sense of the game in the long term helps players to build on these concepts, awesome.

Related to the matter of the temporal dimension of wellness, I am thinking that a good strategy would be to aim for cycles of short term surprises, mid term perceptions of change, and long term consequences. The long term would then drift between recognizing, reflecting, and expressing through these consequences, as players create different goals each time the long term cycles complete.

This is what I have in mind for the “portable roots” way of carrying the game controller, hehe. (http://www.instructables.com/id/Paintbrush-Roll-up-Travel-Kit/)
